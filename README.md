^ The first version that works perfectly!

# To-do: 

-> Comment code properly in preparation for templating. \
-> Create other template versions.\
-> Add buttons for switching templates (?) \
-> Add buttons for the variance of the lower margin. \

Scaling is fixed! No issues with that now.
-> ~~Review and fix scaling issue. (Partly done, just the logo left, but I'm calling it quites for now)~~\
-----> ~~The only real issue is font size. Also, the eyeball logo.~~ \
-----> ~~Nevermind, upon further testing the scaling is still borken, but for strange aspect ratios. I'll get back to this later. Its on superevil now, but make sure to change the code after I'm done.~~\
-> ~~Fix inner margins.~~ \
-> ~~Figure out standards for placement of the logo.~~\


# Template Notes

-> Muted colours (clay-like, terracotta) \
-> Limited colourset (1-3 "colours" + off-whites + black) \
-> Variation in lower margin, other margins don't change \
-> Logo on corner of each \
-> a {director's name} film \
-> Small details in fine print below main image \
-> Realisitc subject vs Abstracted background \
-> Little colour palette sampler rectangle in top corners (size and shap varies) \
-> Random number in lower corner \
-> Posters with the slightly darker white obey a template more than those without. The others will typically have more chaotic formatting. \
