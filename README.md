# Sangrain-HTML
A HTML+CSS recreation of a sandgrain studios poster. 

To-do: 

-> Add buttons for the variance of the lower margin. \
-> ~~Fix inner margins.~~ \
-> Figure out standards for placement of the logo. \
-> Review and fix scaling issue. (IMPORTANT) \

# Template Notes

-> Muted colours (clay-like, terracotta) \
-> Limited colourset (1-3 "colours" + off-whites + black) \
-> Variation in lower margin, other margins don't change \
-> Logo on corner of each \
-> a {director's name} film \
-> Small details in fine print below main image \
-> Realisitc subject vs Abstracted background \
-> Little colour palette sampler rectangle in top corners (size and shap varies) \
-> Random number in lower corner \
-> Posters with the slightly darker white obey a template more than those without. The others will typically have more chaotic formatting. \
